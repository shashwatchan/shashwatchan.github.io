Hi! I'm Shashwat, a final year undergraduate at the National University of Singapore, studying cs and math. Currently, I am interested in deep learning, and specifically large language models. 

Previously, I was doing theoretical cs research and was fortunate to work with [Prof. Yi-Jun Chang](https://sites.google.com/a/umich.edu/yi-jun-chang/) on distributed graph algorithms. I have also spent my summers interning in quantitative trading roles at Jump Trading and Optiver. 

Even earlier, I used to do competitive programming and also participated in the International Olympiad in Informatics twice.
